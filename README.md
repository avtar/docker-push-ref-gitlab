**Note:** GitLab now provides [CI/CD support for GitHub repositories](https://about.gitlab.com/features/github/). This project is no longer necessary. 

# About

This repository is the result of exploratory work that was carried out to test GitHub and GitLab CI integration. The original inspiration was [a post on the sealedabstract website](http://faq.sealedabstract.com/gitlab_mirror/) and some of its configuration files and scripts have been adapted for this work.

The contents have been used to create [a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/avtar/push-ref-gitlab/) that will:

1. Use [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/) to listen to GitHub [push](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent) or [pull request](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestevent) events when changes are either merged in branches or when pull requests are sent via trusted contributors
1. Pass the webhook payload as an argument (please refer to the environment variables below) a [Node.js script](ansible/files/sync-gitlab-mirror.js)

The script will then:

1. Create a matching GitLab project if one does not already exist
1. Enable up a [GitLab CI runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/README.html) for the project in question
1. Enable a [build events webhook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/4278) that will inform [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/) of CI job progress
1. Clone the GitHub repository and set up GitLab as a remote
1. Finally the ref with changes from the original payload will be pushed to the GitLab repository

GitLab CI jobs will be triggered if the GitHub repository contains a [valid](https://gitlab.com/ci/lint) [.gitlab-ci.yml file](https://issues.gpii.net/browse/GPII-2123?focusedCommentId=22422&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-22422). The progress of CI jobs will be communicated using the [GitHub Status API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/) and also be viewable using the [GitLab Pipelines UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines.html).

### Environment Variables

In order to use the supplied container the following environment variables will need to be provided:

* ``BUILD_EVENTS_WEBHOOK_URL`` - This is a URL pointing to where the container is running, for example ``http://<FQDN>:9000/hooks/update-github-status``
* ``GITHUB_USER`` - The GitHub account associated with the repositories that will be generating the push events
* ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` - A GitHub Personal Access Token with the ``repo:status`` scope
* ``GITLAB_USER`` - The GitLab account where GitHub repositories will be mirrored
* ``GITLAB_TOKEN`` - A GitLab Personal Access Token
* ``GITLAB_RUNNER_ID`` - A GitLab CI Runner ID (please refer to notes further below)
* ``GITLAB_HOST`` - ``https://gitlab.com`` should be a safe default unless a self-hosted GitLab instance is being used
* ``CONTRIBUTORS_WHITELIST`` - A comma separated list (no spaces) of GitHub account names that are trusted to trigger CI jobs using their pull request changes
* ``GITLAB_ENABLE_SHARED_RUNNERS`` - Boolean defaults to ``false``, ideally set to ``true`` if a self-hosted GitLab instance is being used

### Start a Container

A container can be started as long as the prerequisites listed below have been met.

```
sudo docker run \
-d -p 9000:9000 \
--name push-ref-gitlab \
-e BUILD_EVENTS_WEBHOOK_URL=http://<FQDN>:9000/hooks/update-github-status \
-e GITLAB_HOST=https://gitlab.com \
-e GITHUB_USER=<github-account-name> \
-e GITHUB_TOKEN=<github-token> \
-e GITLAB_USER=<gitlab-account-name> \
-e GITLAB_TOKEN=<gitlab-token> \
-e GITLAB_RUNNER_ID=<gitlab-ci-runner-id> \
-e CONTRIBUTORS_WHITELIST=github-account1,github-account2 \
avtar/push-ref-gitlab
```

## Prerequisites

Before a container can be used some preparatory work is needed. The following tasks only need to be performed once unless the runner is  moved to a different host or its details change in any other way. 

After these steps any merge activity in the configured GitHub repositories will trigger GitLab CI jobs.

### Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/ to create a new personal access token. Only the ``repo:status`` scope needs to be granted.

### Create a GitLab Test Project

Visit https://gitlab.com/projects/new to create a temporary test project.

A project name such as ``test-project`` can be used. This project won't be used for any CI jobs, it is just need in order to obtain a CI runner token which unfortunately isn't offered by other means. If a self-hosted GitLab instance is being used then shared CI runners would be an option and these extra steps wouldn't be required.

### Set Up a GitLab Runner

A GitLab Runner can be hosted on your personal computer or in a data centre. Runners will have access to secrets depending on what your CI jobs entail.

### Obtain a GitLab CI Runner Token

Visit ``https://gitlab.com/<your-account-name>/test-project/runners`` and search for the ``Use the following registration token during setup: <runner-token>`` text. Make a note of this token.

### Install a Runner
* [macOS/OS X](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/osx.html)
* [Linux](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/linux-repository.html)
* [Windows](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/windows.html)

### Register a Runner 

```
gitlab-runner register \
--non-interactive \
--registration-token "<runner-token>" \
--url "https://gitlab.com/" \
--name "<any-name-will-suffice>" \
--executor "shell"
```

### Start a Runner Interactively

The following command will start the runner in the foreground and not as a service, allowing you to observe its activity:

``gitlab-runner --debug run``

To stop the process you will need to type ``CTRL-C``.

### Obtain the Runner's ID

Visit ``https://gitlab.com/<your-account-name>/<your-test-project-name>/runners`` and copy the number prepended by the ``#`` character.

### Set Up a GitHub Webhook

Visit ``https://github.com/<your-account>/<your-project>/settings/hooks/new`` to create a new webhook. Each project that needs to make use of GitLab CI will need to have these hooks configured.

* The only text field that needs to be populated is the ``Payload URL``. The URL will resemble the following example: ``http://<FQDN>:9000/hooks/sync-gitlab-mirror``

* The ``Content type`` should be set to ``application/json``.

* ``Send me everything`` should be selected.
